# Historical Context

## Session: 2025-11-22

### Changes

-   Fixed CSS build error where `@import` was placed after other rules.
-   Verified `app/globals.css` content to ensure the `@import` is at the top (line 3).
-   Cleared `.next` build cache to resolve persistent stale error messages.

### Files Updated

-   `app/globals.css`: Moved `@import url("https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/pp-neue-montreal");` from line 6 to line 3, preceding `@custom-variant`.
